# Depression-Detection

This repository contains the resources and codebase for a machine learning project dedicated to detecting symptoms of depression from various data inputs from the twitter chats. The goal of this project is to create a robust and sensitive model that can assist healthcare professionals and individuals in early identification and intervention of depression.


Due to large size of the dataset I could not be able to upload the dataset here on github, Instead of that i uploaded that on Google Drive and the link is below from there you can access and download the data. Happy Cloning! from Hemant
